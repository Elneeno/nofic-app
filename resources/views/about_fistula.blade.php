          <li>Obstetric Fistula is an abnormal opening in the women genital as a result of complication of giving Birth which leads to continuous leakage of urine and sometimes feces from the womansâ€™ genital. The baby usually dies because of the difficult and prolonged labor. These women suffer greatly from their plight, which include stigmatization, depression abandonment due to the offensive smell of urine/stool. </li>

          <li>Women with Obstetric Fistulae are admitted and treated mainly through surgical repairs free of charge in our Centre. Following the repair these women are rehabilitated and empowered with a trade and Live skills and supported to be integrated back into their communities. </li>

          <li>We work with different organizations and communities toward prevention of Obstetric Fistula. It is our hope that obstetric Fistula will be eliminated in Nigeria soon through the provision of excellent, accessible, and affordable Obstetric services to Nigerian. We continue to strive to be a Centre of excellence in Urogynaecology as we bring service, hope and smile to all women. </li>

        <p>It is estimated that Nigeria accounts for 40% of the worldwide fistula prevalence with approximately 20,000 new cases occurring each year, although recent studies put estimates at approximately 12,000 new cases per year. There is a strong association between reproductive risk and high fertility, illiteracy, poverty and lack of or poor-quality medical care.</p>
        <p>Obstetric fistula (OF) is a burden mostly affecting the poor, the illiterate and young women who live in rural areas devoid of access to information and services. Furthermore, some socio-cultural beliefs and practices are known to be harmful to the health of women. </p>
        <p>Despite all this, obstetric fistula can be prevented, by awareness creation, removing ideological norms that impede uptake of services and emergency obstetric care.</p>

        <h4><strong>The Burden of Fistula</strong></h4>
        <p>Obstetric fistulae (vesico-vaginal and recto-vaginal fistulae) are serious reproductive health problems for women in Nigeria, even as fistulae have been practically eliminated in developed countries. It occurs as a result of obstruction from whatever cause during childbirth, leading to tissue damage and the typical clinical presentation of continuous leakage of urine or feces or both through the vagina. Worldwide, obstructed labour occurs in an estimated 5% of live births and accounts for 8% of maternal deaths. </p>

        <p>Adolescent girls are particularly susceptible to obstructed labor, because their pelvises are not fully developed. The constant leakage of urine and/or feces through the vagina and the unbearable smell it causes leads to social isolation of the victims, and attendant severe physical and mental ill-health.</p>
